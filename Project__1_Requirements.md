
Project #1: The Game
Overview
Let’s start with something fun - a game!

Everyone will get a chance to be creative, and work through some really tough programming challenges. It’s up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

You will be working individually for this project, but we’ll be guiding you along the process and helping you as you go. Show us what you’ve got!

--------------------REQUIREMENTS------------------
Your app must:

- Render a game in the browser

- Use Javascript or jQuery for DOM manipulation

 - Design logic for winning & visually display win/lose

- Be depoloyed online to GitHub Pages, where the rest of the world can access it

- Look visually appealing


--------------------BEST PRACTICES REQUIRED------------------
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Create a separate folder for all your js files, one for all the images, one for all the css, etc. 
- You main page MUST be called index.html
- You must have a readme file that include a description of the game, etc.(create one manually, do not check the box on github)
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principles
- Make a mobile version for your game
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
-Make sure to indent you code (you can use a plugin for VS code called beautify )



BONUS 
- Switch turns between two players
- Create a mobile version 
- Make your game responsive




Necessary Deliverables
A working game, built by you that runs in the browser
A deploy of your game in GitHub Pages
A link to your hosted working game in the URL section of your GitHub repo
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
Suggested Ways to Get Started


Tips
-You can find some sample landing pages at w3layouts.com/games (or by googling similar things)
-Break the project down into different steps (logic & data structures, layout and rendering, DOM manipulation & user interaction). Use whiteboards to conceptualize your game!
-Use your Development Tools (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
-Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know… procrastinating
-Commit early, commit often, don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version
-Consult documentation resources (MDN, jQuery, etc.) to understand better the tools you are using & the available help you will get
-Don’t be afraid of the black screen, make it work and, if needed, refactor your code. If you need to create code (as in console.log) to test what you are doing, you can always delete it
